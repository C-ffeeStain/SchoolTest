# School Test

Ever wanted to go back to school to relearn a bunch of random facts? Probably not, but here's a test that combines several different school subjects together to create a unique test every time! You'll end up googling the answers, because that's what I did for some of these questions.

## Adding Your Own Questions

To add your own questions, look in the `questions` folder. There you will see a list of files for each subject's questions. There may eventually be true/false questions. The line with the question in it must start with `Q: `, and the answer list line must start with `A: `. Each answer must be seperated by two commas (`,,`).Here's an example:

```text
Q: How old are you?
A: <18,,20-30,,40-50,,>50
```
